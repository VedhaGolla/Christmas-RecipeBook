    <p class="description">Simple roast turkey just like grandma used to make. Seasoned with salt and pepper and basted with turkey stock, the flavors of the turkey really stand out.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <h3>Turkey</h3>
		  	<ul>
            <li>1 (18 pound) whole turkey</li>
            <li>8 cups prepared stuffing</li>
            <li>½ cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
            <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 ½ quarts turkey stock, divided</li>
			</ul>
        
        <h3>Stuffing</h3>
		  	<ul>
            <li>30 slices white bread, lightly toasted</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
            <li>1 large onion, finely chopped</li>
            <li>2 stalks celery, finely chopped</li>
            <li>2 cups chicken broth</li>
            <li>2 large eggs, lightly beaten</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons water, or as needed (Optional)</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons rubbed sage</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
			</ul>
        <h2>Directions for Stuffing</h2>
        <ol> 
            <li>Spread toasted bread slices on baking sheets and let sit out at room temperature until hard, about 24 hours.</li>
            <li>Once bread slices are ready, gather all ingredients.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
            <li>Crush bread slices into crumbs with a rolling pin. Transfer crumbs to a large bowl.</li>
            <li>Melt butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Stir in onion and celery; cook and stir until soft, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove from heat and drain.</li>
            <li>Add chicken broth and eggs to bread crumbs; mix until combined and moist, but not mushy. Add water, if necessary, to attain desired consistency. Mix in cooked onion and celery, sage, garlic powder; season with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Press dressing mixture into the prepared baking dish.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the top is brown and crisp, about 1 hour.</li>
			</ol>
    
        <h2>Directions for Turkey</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Place a rack in the lowest position of the oven.</li>
            <li>Remove the turkey neck and giblets. Pat the turkey dry with paper towels, then place it (breast-side up) on a rack in a roasting pan.</li>
            <li>Loosely fill turkey cavity with stuffing. Rub skin with butter, then season with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Pour 2 cups of turkey stock into the roasting pan.</li>
            <li>Loosely tent turkey with aluminum foil, and roast turkey for 2 ½ hours, basting with pan juices every 30 minutes. When drippings evaporate, add remaining stock to the pan, 1 to 2 cups at a time.</li>
            <li>Remove foil and continue roasting until a meat thermometer inserted in thickest part of thigh reads 165 degrees F (75 degrees C), about 1 ½ hours more.</li>
            <li>Transfer turkey to a large serving platter. Let stand for 20 to 30 minutes before carving.</li>
